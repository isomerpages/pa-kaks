<h2>JoyPlus</h2>
<p>JoyPlus is a quarterly programme aimed at alleviating the cost of living
for less privileged residents. Rather than distributing common groceries
and food items door-to-door, JoyPlus enables residents to "shop" for essential
items, including food, household necessities, toys, and electrical appliances.</p>
