<h4><strong>For Specific Cause</strong></h4>
<p>Meet like-minded individuals and join hands to volunteer as a group towards
a common community goal. The Community Volunteer Scheme allows you to take
part in cause-based events and programmes that may also benefit from your
professional skills. For example, you could assist in befriending a senior,
mentoring underprivileged youth, environmental clean-up initiatives or
organising festive celebrations for the less privileged.</p>
<h4><strong>Ad-Hoc Volunteering</strong></h4>
<p>Not ready to commit as a Grassroots Leader or don’t have a specific-cause?
Try ad-hoc volunteering! This is a great gateway to becoming more involved
in the community. You can participate in one-time events or short-term
projects that fit your schedule. This flexible approach allows you to explore
different areas of interest, meet diverse people, and see where your passions
lie.</p>
<h4><strong>As a Grassroots Leader</strong></h4>
<p>Bring together people from all walks of life and encourage community involvement,
raise awareness about community issues, understand government policies,
gather feedback and support the needy.</p>
