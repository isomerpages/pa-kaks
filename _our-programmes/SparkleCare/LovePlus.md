<p>The LovePlus programme brings residents together for year-round sit-down
meals. It fosters a sense of community, offers home assistance, and provides
a warm environment for sharing stories and forming lasting connections.
LovePlus aims to reduce isolation by creating a welcoming atmosphere during
these shared meals.</p>
